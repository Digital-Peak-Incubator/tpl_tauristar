What is this?
---------------------
This repository shows an approach how to introduce CSS/JS frameworks like bootstrap 3 or font awesome into the current Joomla version without breaking backwards compatibility.

How to get started?
---------------------
Install Joomla as usual by downloading it from this repository. As default template is tauristar set, which loads the bootstrap 3 framework without any template overrides.

You can install the sample blog data on the last installation screen or create some sample articles by yourself.

What is new?
---------------------
Templates define which framework (bs3, bs4) they want to work with and then the layouts are loaded with prefixes like bs3 according to the template (framework parameter)[templates/tauristar/templateDetails.xml#L48]. For example when tauristar is activated, then the file (default.bs3.php)[modules/mod_menu/tmpl/default.bs3.php] is loaded instead of the (default.php)[modules/mod_menu/tmpl/default.php] file. The same works for component views and JLayouts.

If the framework parameter is not set, then the layout is loaded as before. Like that backwards compatibility is guaranteed.
